    git push -u origin new-branch

## Pull Requests

Once the new branch has been published to GitHub, the next step will be to create a new pull request to merge the new branch with the `main` branch.

After creating the pull request, it will go through a review and the request will either be accepted or declined based on needs, code quality, testing problems or any other reason that will be included in the commit message or request declined message.
