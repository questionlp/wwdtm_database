## Pull Requests

Once the new branch has been published to Github, the next step will be to
create a new pull request to merge the new branch with the `develop` branch.

After creating the pull request, it will go through a review and the request
will either be accepted or declined based on needs, code quality, testing
problems or any other reason that will be included in the commit message or
request declined message.

Pull requests from new branches to the `main` branch that do not go through
the `develop` branch via a pull request will be declined.
